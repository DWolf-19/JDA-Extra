# JDA-Extra
![JDA-Extra](banner.png)
---
A modern and evolving commands & components framework for JDA. Inspired by [JDA-Utilities](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities) and [BotCommands](https://github.com/freya022/BotCommands).
# Plans
In the first alpha we plan to make full support of prefix/slash/hybrid commands, their configuration and events. Context commands/components support will be introduced in the upcoming alpha versions. 
> **Warning**
> We do not recommended using this framework in production until the first beta/stable release. In future alpha versions and in the main branch, the library interface may break (or rather, 100%).
### Killer-features
* Hybrid commands (maximally unified interface between prefix/slash commands)
* "1 class - 1 command" principle that increases the modularity of bots written on this framework
* This solution is initially sharpened for the new Discord functionality and has a redesigned architecture
