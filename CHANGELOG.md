# 1.0.0-alpha.2

### ‚≠ê Overview
This release contains major improvements related to events and localization support.

#### Events

Command events no more depends (extends) on the JDA's upstream events. 
`SlashCommandEvent`, `PrefixCommandEvent` and `HybridCommandEvent` are now proxies/containers for source events 
(`SlashCommandInteractionEvent`, `MessageReceivedEvent`), which allows us to isolate unnecessary methods.
Interaction with events has become more native and clean.

**Note:** `HybridCommandEvent` doesn't having at the moment `reply**` methods, 
because it needs the unified interface between `ReplyCallbackAction` and `MessageCreateAction`. Wait for updates.

#### Localization

4 new annotations for slash/hybrid commands have been added:
* `@NameLocalizations`
* `@DescriptionLocalizations`
* `@Localization` (used inside two above)
* `@CommandLocalizationFunction`

Example:
```java
@ExtraSlashCommand(description = "Standard description")
// Localizations will be displayed depending on language of the Discord client
@NameLocalizations({
        @Localization(locale = DiscordLocale.GERMAN, string = "hallo"), 
        @Localization(locale = DiscordLocale.RUSSIAN, string = "–ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç")
})
@DescriptionLocalizations({
        @Localization(locale = DiscordLocale.GERMAN, string = "Beschreibung auf Deutsch"),
        @Localization(locale = DiscordLocale.RUSSIAN, string = "–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º")
})
// This allows you to localize the entire command including name, description and options
// It uses ResourceBundleLocalizationFunction under the hood
// See https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA/blob/master/src/examples/java/LocalizationExample.java#L21 for explanation
@CommandLocalizationFunction(baseName = "localizations", locales = {
        DiscordLocale.GERMAN, DiscordLocale.RUSSIAN
})
public class SlashCommandExample extends SlashCommand {
    @ExtraMainCommand
    public void hello(SlashCommandEvent event, @SlashOption(name = "name", description = "Your name") String name) {
        event.replyFormat("Hello, %s!", name).queue();
    }
}
```

And the same with hybrid commands. 
Keep in mind that this only works when hybrid command is called as a slash (obviously).

# 1.0.0-alpha.1

### ‚≠ê Overview
This release contains changes starting from first commit and introducing some core concepts of internal work and interacting with the framework.

#### API

You need a `JDAExtraBuilder` to configure the framework. 
You can define various settings and bind commands to `JDAExtra` instance.

```java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create JDAExtraBuilder instance
        // Set prefix for prefix (text)/hybrid commands and that mentions of your bot will be considered as a prefix
        JDAExtraBuilder jdaExtra = new JDAExtraBuilder().setWhenMentionOr("!")
                // Bind command class(es) to JDA-Extra
                // There will be a more flexible and user-friendly API in the future, 
                // but for now just list the command classes
                .addSlashCommands(new SlashCommandExample());

        JDABuilder.createDefault("TOKEN")
                .enableIntents(GatewayIntent.MESSAGE_CONTENT)
                // build() returns configured instance of JDA-Extra,
                // main class which will handle events from JDA (SlashCommandInteractionEvent, etc.)
                .addEventListeners(jdaExtra.build())
                .build();
    }
}
```

This is a basic example of a command, your class should inherit from a basic abstract class like `SlashCommand`, etc.

```java
// Command annotation. Here you can define command name and description
@ExtraSlashCommand(description = "My cool command")
public class SlashCommandExample extends SlashCommand {
    @ExtraMainCommand // Command entry point. There will be a separate guide about the entry points
    public void ping(SlashCommandEvent event, @SlashOption(name = "name", description = "Your name") String name) {
        // And now you can work with all methods from SlashCommandInteractionEvent!
        event.replyFormat("Pong, %s!", name).queue();
    }
}
```

As you may have noticed, you didn't specify the command name in some annotation.
JDA-Extra took it from the method name! In our case, `ping`. 
But if you need to, you can define it via `@ExtraSlashCommand(name = "name", description = "...")`, 
command name defined in the annotation will override method name of the main entry point.

The option type is taken from parameter type. You can also redefine this in the option annotation.

**Note:** JDA-Extra can't take option name from parameter name due to limitations in the Java Reflection API, 
so you must **ALWAYS** define the option name in annotation. _Perhaps_ we will circumvent this limitation a little later.

The text command is identical:

```java
@ExtraPrefixCommand
public class PrefixCommandExample extends PrefixCommand {
    @ExtraMainCommand
    public void hello(PrefixCommandEvent event, @PrefixOption(name = "name") String name) {
        // Shortcut for getMessage().replyFormat()
        event.replyFormat("Hello, %s!", name).queue();
    }
}
```

`PrefixCommandEvent` has all `MessageReceivedEvent` methods and a lot of useful shortcuts (currently only various `reply**` methods).

#### Main killer-feature: hybrid commands

You can define:

```java
@ExtraHybridCommand(description = "My cool command")
public class HybridCommandExample extends HybridCommand {
    @ExtraMainCommand
    public void hybrid(HybridCommandEvent event, @HybridOption(name = "name", description = "Your name") String name) {
        event.replyFormat("Hello, %s!", name).queue();
    }
}
```

...and you will receive a command that is processed both as a prefix and as a slash!
You can check this by running our example and type in some channel `/hybrid DWolf_19` and `!hybrid DWolf_19`.

#### Exceptions

You can see that JDA-Extra can throw exceptions during runtime, such as `CommandNotFoundException`, etc. 
At the moment, you do not have functionality to control and handle exceptions. Just wait for updates.

#### Philosophy

Unlike for example JDA-Utilities, JDA-Extra has a different approach to work: the framework will never do what you did not set. 
There are no default mechanisms that will respond to the user with a predefined message in case of an error with the command. 
You will receive an error, its handling depends on you. JDA-Extra is a tool, in order for it to work, you need to configure it as you need. 
This does not mean that we are abandoning all the "default behavior", of course. 
One of the reasons for creating this solution was unpredictable behavior of other command-handlers, who decided for the developer what to do.
